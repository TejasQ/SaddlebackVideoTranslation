# grunt-init-cep

> Create an empty Creative Cloud extension project ready to be used with [grunt-cep](https://github.com/fcamarlinghi/grunt-cep).

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fcamarlinghi/grunt-init-cep.git ~/.grunt-init/cep
```

Windows users, see [the documentation](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) for the correct destination directory path.

## Usage

At the command-line, create a new directory or `cd` into an empty one, run the following command and follow the prompts:

```shell
grunt-init cep
```

> **Please note:** this template will generate files in the current directory only if it's empty, so be sure to change to a new directory first.

Once you have run the command, you need to install `grunt-cep` and its dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

You are now ready to start developing your extension. You can test the extension boilerplate inside the targeted application by running:

```shell
grunt cep:debug
```

Please refer to the [grunt-cep](https://github.com/fcamarlinghi/grunt-cep) documentation for additional details.
